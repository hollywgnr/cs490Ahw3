MV,I went on my first date to see this movie.
CLG,"Fellow grad instructor here - pandemic or no, this is pretty unacceptable."

MV,Go watch DOA  or KISS ME DEADLY  and tell me those movies are boring or slow.
MV,They are tenses and faster than most movies made today.
MV,His saving grace is that Roger Deakins is usually there to save his ass.
OTH,&#x200B;  EDIT: also what a silly cop out of an answer.
MV,"\""The movie is boring\"" ITS SUPPOSED TO BE!"
OTH,I am mean how many words with single meaning are required to understand the universe around us.
OTH,Also all technical jargon can be dropped off.
CLG,No synonyms like computation and calculation .
OTH,Can you elaborate why the knowledge and sense of a word is not same at 2 points of life.
MV,I love this so much that I want to see the nonexistent movie in this trailers.

CLG,"if you\u2019re looking for a social life, try to get out of there or make friends with kids elsewhere"

MV,"Wow, Gal Gadot really is a beauty, isn't she."
OTH,Some people are just breathtakingly good looking.
CLG,This program look more intended towards linguistics  than computational linguistics.

MV,"Yes, a good home setup goes a long way to ameliorating the absence of a theatre\u2019s resources."
OTH,The best I can hope from an audience is everyone is quiet and attentive.
OTH,But it\u2019s unrealistic to expect everyone to behave like I do.

POL,It only makes sense the inferior version would release during Corona.
OTH,I don't know why I was downvoted to hell though I was clearly just confused
CLG,I live in Amherst and I have been socially distancing and basically staying at home since March.
CLG,Amherst has kept their numbers down because the majority of its residents has acted in a socially responsible way.
POL,I also have family members who are at risk for COVID.
OTH,ETA: Thank you for the award!

CLG,I guess I'll have my first experience at UMass next year.
CLG,"So with the spreading out, I\u2019m assuming that means they\u2019re moving on campus people into different rooms/buildings right?"
CLG,I have on campus labs so I\u2019m kinda stuck :/
MV,Have you seen Howl?
OTH,Well you pretty much acted like your opinion is an undeniable fact.

MV,WING COMMANDER  That is all...
CLG,[[link]  Here is a visual of where undergrads end up.

CLG,I\u2019m going to get it from the library today!
CLG,"As a beginner in NLP, please correct me if I\u2019m wrong."
CLG,"I have access to GPT-3, and I\u2019ve done some experiments with it."

OTH,What is being defined as sentient?
OTH,You seem so kind and genuine.
CLG,"As far as I understand \\~140M/160M Tweets are  retweets, duplicates and close duplicates."

POL,The IDF aren't terrorist the Palestinians are.

OTH,To give you a ballpark figure.
CLG,The French dictionary Tr\u00e9sor de la langue fran\u00e7aise has 100k words with 270k definitions and 430k examples.
CLG,So at least for French you can infer that context reduce 430 to 100.
OTH,What do you want to know?
CLG,Or the number of meanings throughout all languages?
CLG,You can't assume that every language has the same sememes.
CLG,That's more than the number of definitions in the TLF but in the same ballpark.
CLG,So it's hard to answer for human languages as a whole.
CLG,Do words like counters in Asian languages have a meaning?
CLG,So the 430k examples of the TLF is probably a good approximation of the number of unique sememes.
CLG,"There'll be massive overlap of course, things like \""food\"", \""water\"", etc will be in every language."
CLG,French doesn't differentiate like English between in-laws and step family.
CLG,"Lots of languages differentiate between older and younger brothers and sisters, while English and French do not."
CLG,"French doesn't have a word for sibling, etc."
OTH,What are we counting here as one meaning?
OTH,"So sibling is one meaning, ane  is another."
OTH,Imagine doing this for all human languages...
OTH,The myth of the 50 words for snow in Eskimo points at this issue.
OTH, Are you going to count 50 sememes or one here?
OTH,So stick to a language first.
CLG,Assume 300k to 400k sememes per language.
MV,-  Bladerunner 2049 -  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.
MV,Is this how you watched Hereditary?
MV,I'm just a sucker for an underdog story I guess.

OTH,"The mother wins the lottery and immediately dies, leaving everything to the child whose life is infinitely better."
CLG,Language doesn't need to pack as much data into each letter as possible.
CLG,Letters or even words have no inherent meaning and don't need one.
CLG,The arbitrariness of the relationship between the sign and the signified is a well-known feature of all human languages.
CLG,A great deal of study has gone into it.
CLG,That's not to say they \\*shouldn't\\* have inherent meaning.
CLG,Just that no language in the history of humanity has found the need to require it.
CLG,"&#x200B;  Relatedly, grammar \\*is\\* semantics."
CLG,The grammar contains information integral to the understanding of the sentence.
CLG,You are getting stuck on details that don't matter.
OTH,"Again, you could design a world/language where they do, it's just that the one we already have doesn't care."
OTH,"Sounds good, I will take a closer look."
OTH,They used Reddit :)
CLG,"My guess is that labs, visual arts, and performance classes  will be on-campus, possibly in smaller class sizes."

MV,"Mel Brooks: Blazing saddles, History of the World Pt I & II , The Producers ."

CLG,"also, you don\u2019t have to be apart of umass\u2019s party culture to enjoy your time here."
OTH,"When I think of life without her, it feels ..."
MV,Is that why they released the sequel trilogy in 3D?
MV,There\u2019s nothing to back this up....VOD is at best making a tiny fraction of theatrical releases
MV,"The plot, or at least the protagonist\u2019s logic/motives stopped making sense at the very end."
MV,"Right up until then it was an authentic, gripping story."
CLG,I'm pretty sure Longformer is a self-supervised language model.
CLG,Doc2vec is also self-supervised.
POL,> They cannot refuse a legal order from the politicians who run the country.
POL,"They can, if it breaks the geneva convention, or one of many other resolutions that have come forth since."
POL,"Dear liberals,  bernie sanders politics weren\u2019t socialism."
POL,it was social democracy.
POL,"socialism doesn\u2019t mean \u201cwe all love each other\u201d, or \u201cgovernment does some stuff\u201d."
POL,Socialism is an economic system.
POL,Where workers control the means of production.
POL,"Fred Hampton was a communist, aswell."
POL,He believed in a world united in solidarity as an international working class.
POL,One where the working class control society.
POL,One where all people have a home and food.
POL,"One where no classes exist, no rich people, no poor people."
OTH,"just people, living in peace."
POL,"A world where government is abolished, and replaced with the community rule and direct democracy."
POL,Liberalism is against the working class.

POL,"As Fred Hampton would say, being against socialism is being against yourself."
OTH,"If you wear a shirt during beach volleyball, you get fined $5."

OTH,i just checked mine and it's the same.

MV,"The cast all went on to do well, but the Director Michael Cimino flamed out almost immediately."

MV,"The trailer had me leaning towards \""not interested.\"""
OTH,Yeah that makes sense   I am a planner and I hate not being able to plan ...
MV,"He didn't sue them, Studio Candal did."
CLG,"With programming, it\u2019s generally best to try to actually make programs."
CLG,Just studying languages and theory without putting it to use will result in a lot of wasted time.
CLG,"That is, they had to get internet, other equipment for remote instruction, food, emergency housing, travel, etc."
OTH,It's only been a thing for about a week.
MV,I've only seen it once in the theaters but I remember a lot of details.
MV,The child that kills herself because she can't grow old anymore.
OTH,No one had even spoken a word about it to get.
OTH,Apparently it was something they all did every trip.
OTH,So she invited herself and went with them.
OTH,I believe it was the last time it happened.
